### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 
My Name is MohammadYoussof 

I am interested in computational seismic imaging. Besides being a fan of the geophysical inverse problems, I employ seismic wave observations to apply a variety of techniques, including tomography, receiver function imaging, moment tensor inversion.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Uncertainty quantification of seismic imaging
using informed proposal of Markov chain Monte Carlo.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of things
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything has uncertainty quantification
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with OpenGL
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about seismic imaging technique
