- ðŸ”­ I am interested in computational seismic imaging.
Besides being a fan of the geophysical inverse problems, I employ seismic wave observations to apply a variety of techniques such as tomography, receiver function imaging, moment tensor inversion, relocation analysis, and shear wave splitting methods.
- âš¡ Iâ€™m currently working on Uncertainty quantification of seismic imaging
using informed proposal of Markov chain Monte Carlo.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of things especially in HPC.
- ðŸ¤” I am interested in hearing from prospective collaborators whose research interests overlap with mine. If you have interests that are similar to mine, please drop me a line.  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about seismic imaging techniques.
